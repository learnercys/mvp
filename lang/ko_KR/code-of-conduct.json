    "Being involved in the elementary community is an incredible experience; you get to be a part of something big, collaborate with people from around the world, and help people make their computers awesome. However, with that comes a responsibility to follow a predefined set of rules that ensures the best environment for all involved. The following rules are expected to be adhered to anytime you&rsquo;re involved with the community, be it on the elementary website, in an official IRC room, in person, or elsewhere.": "elementary 커뮤니티에 참여한다는 것은 굉장한 경험입니다. 당신은 큰 무언가의 일부가 될 것이고, 세계의 사람들과 협력할 것이며, 사람들이 그들의 컴퓨터로 엄청난 것을 하도록 도울것입니다. 하지만, 관련된 모든 것에 대해 최상의 환경을 보장하는 미리 정의된 규칙을 따라야할 책임이 있습니다. 당신이 커뮤니티에 참여하는 동안 언제든 규칙을 따라야 합니다. elementary 웹사이트 에서든, 공식 IRC방에서든, 개인적으로든, 어디에서든.",
    "I. Respect": "I. 존중",
    "Respecting others is paramount. Be sure to respect people and their opinions, personal background, privacy, and ideas. The elementary community is not a place for disrespectful or hurtful remarks for any reason whatsoever. When giving criticism, approach it constructively and respectfully. Personal attacks are not tolerated. When receiving constructive criticism, take it into consideration and thank the critic for their input, no matter your stance.": "다른 사람을 존중하는 것은 매우 중요합니다. 다른 사람과 그들의 의견, 개인의 배경, 사생활 및 아이디어를 존중해야 하는 것을 잊지 마세요. elementary community는 그 어떠한 이유에서도 무례하거나 상처가 되는 발언을 위한 장소가 아닙니다. 비판을 하는 경우 건설적이고 정중하게 해주세요. 인신 공격은 용납되지 않습니다. 건설적인 비판을 받을 때에는 한번 고려해보시고 자신의 의견이 어떻든 비판을 보내준 사람에게 감사를 표해주세요.",
    "II. Content": "II. 내용",
    "The elementary community is made up of thousands of users of varying ages, beliefs, and levels of maturity. Because of this, you must be conscious of the content you produce and the remarks you make. No nudity, excess vulgarity, political content, religious content, or inappropriate content should appear in relation to elementary. Ultimately, the elementary moderators have the final say as to what constitutes as inappropriate. If in doubt, consider whether or not it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;d show to a room full of people including children and grandmothers from around the world. If you&rsquo;re hesitant, don&rsquo;t do it.": "The elementary community is made up of thousands of users of varying ages, beliefs, and levels of maturity.

    "III. Rumors and Speculation": "III. Rumors and Speculation",
    "While the fast-paced and exciting nature of elementary contributes to the want to spread rumors or speculation, avoid it. Discussing future plans is alright, but anytime it&rsquo;s not a verified fact, disclose it as personal speculation or do not discuss it. Spreading inaccurate information can be detrimental to the community, especially if spread in a negative light.": "While the fast-paced and exciting nature of elementary contributes to the want to spread rumors or speculation, avoid it.

    "elementary is powered by individuals coming together in their free time to create something special. It&rsquo;s important to respect that fact and to always try to contribute to healthy, helpful discussion. If in a meeting, keep on-topic and stay quiet unless you have something helpful that pertains to the immediate discussion. If commenting on the website, keep the discussion related to the content of the Journal entry or Answer topic. If participating in a developer-oriented discussion such as a mailing list or developer IRC channel, do not create unnecessary noise by discussing non-development topics; this only derails the discussion and muddies up the logs for developers who may not be present.": "elementary is powered by individuals coming together in their free time to create something special.

    "As a primarily online-based community, it&rsquo;s important we avoid the potentially negative aspects of the Internet. Do not troll; starting fights or making remarks with the sole purpose of making someone mad is childish and unacceptable. Spam is also unacceptable; this includes posting links to irrelevant sites and repeatedly posting links to the same site. If someone is trolling or spamming, ignore and flag the user.": "As a primarily online-based community, it’s important we avoid the potentially negative aspects of the Internet.

When we work together, our work and ideas are no longer just our own; they belong to the elementary community as a whole. Inform other members of the team that you intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work.
