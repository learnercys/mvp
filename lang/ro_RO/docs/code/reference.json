    "Now that you've stepped through the developer guide like a champ, we have some reference materials for you. This would be a great place to bookmark and refer back to when you have questions about elementary development.": "Acum că ai trecut prin ghidul dezvoltatorului ca un adevărat campion, avem niște materiale de referință pentru tine. Acesta va fi un loc bun de salvat ca semn de carte și să te întorci la el ori de câte ori ai întrebări legate de dezvoltarea elementary.",
    "Code Style": "Stilul de Cod",
    "The purpose of this guide is to provide clean and accurate instructions on\nwriting good code across all elementary projects. This guideline is to be\nfollowed on every file, in order to keep our code consistent and readable. We\nare also inheriting some of the GNOME's Vala guidelines to keep our code\nconsistent with other Vala programs.": "Scopul acestui ghid este de a oferii instrucțiuni clare și precise legate de\nscrierea corectă de cod pentru toate proiectele elementary. Acest ghid de orientare trebuie\nurmat în fiecare fișier, pentru a menține un cod consistent și lizibil. De asemenea noi\nmoștenim o parte din ghidul de orientare Vala al celor de la GNOME pentru a ne menține codul\nconsistent cu alte programe Vala.",
    "If the guidelines here proposed are followed, newcomers to elementary\ndevelopment will be more easily able to join the development and\nunderstand code. Besides, it'll make it easier for all developers to work on\napplications that they don't usually work on, because the code will be\nconsistent. Finally, as Guido Van Rossum said - &quot;Code is much more often read\nthan written&quot;, so having nicely written code is crucial.": "Dacă instrucțiunile de orientare propuse aici sunt urmate, noii veniți în dezvoltarea\nelementary vor putea să se alăture mult mai ușor procesului de dezvoltare\nși vor înțelege mai bine codul. Pe lângă asta, va fi mai ușor dezvoltatorilor să lucreze\npe aplicații pe care în mod normal nu lucrează, deoarece codul va fi\nconsistent. Într-un final, la fel cum a zis Guido Van Rossum: „Codul este mai des citit decât scris”,\ndeci având un cod scris organizat și aranjat este crucial.",

    "White space comes before opening parentheses:": "Spațiile albe vin înainte de deschiderea parantezelor:",
    "Whitespace goes in all maths-related code, between numbers and operators.": "Spațiile albe intră în orice cod legat de operații matematice, între numere și operatori.",
    "Indentation": "Indentare",

    "On conditionals and loops, always use braces even if there's only one line of code:": "Pe condiționale și bucle, folosiți întotdeauna acolade, chiar dacă există o singură linie de cod:",

    "If you are checking the same variable more than twice, use switch/case instead of multiple else/if:": "Dacă verifici aceeași variabilă mai mult de două ori, folosește switch/case în loc de multiple else/if:",

    "Variable names, class names, function names": "Numele variabilelor, numele claselor, numele funcțiilor",
    "Also worth referring that there should be no Hungarian notation, and no mix of\nany kinds of notations.": "De asemenea, merită menționat că nu trebuie să existe notații în maghiară și nu se amestecă\nniciun fel de notații.",
